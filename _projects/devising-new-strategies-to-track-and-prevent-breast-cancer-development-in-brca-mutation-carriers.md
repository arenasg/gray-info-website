title: Devising new strategies to track and prevent breast cancer development in BRCA mutation carriers
project_lead: Joan Brugge, PhD
team: Brugge, Nathanson, Ellisen, Aparicio, Long, Dillon, Garber
research_questions:
  - How do basal and luminal breast cells contribute to BRCA-related cancers?
  - How do BRCA tumor cells evolve?
  - What are the molecular defects during tumor evolution?
  - How do we detection cancer evolution in carriers?
  - How do we intercept and eradicate tumor development?

The overall goal of this project is to better understand the earliest stages of BRCA cancer development, in order to design strategies to prevent its progression to frank cancer.

Dr. Joan Brugge’s laboratory studies the mechanisms of cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance in breast, ovarian and other BRCA-related cancers. Specifically, Brugge’s team investigates tumor heterogeneity, cell-cell interactions, tumor microenvironment, cancer metabolism, drug resistance, and cell signaling using wide collection of tools, including 3D/organoid cell cultures, genetically-engineered and transplantation-based animal models, single-cell analysis, metabolomics, high-throughput microscopy, and other advanced technologies.
