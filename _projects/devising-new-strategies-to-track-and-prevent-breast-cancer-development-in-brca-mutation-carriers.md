title: Devising new strategies to track and prevent breast cancer development in BRCA mutation carriers
project_lead: Joan Brugge, PhD
team: Aparicio, Dillon, Lin, Santagata, Garber, Venkitaraman
research_questions:
  - How do basal and luminal breast cells contribute to BRCA-related cancers?
  - How do BRCA tumor cells evolve?
  - What are the molecular defects during tumor evolution?
  - How do we detection cancer evolution in carriers?
  - How do we intercept and eradicate tumor development?

Dr. Joan Brugge’s laboratory studies the mechanisms of cancer initiation, progression, and drug resistance in breast, ovarian and other BRCA-related cancers. Specifically, Brugge’s team investigates tumor heterogeneity, cell-cell interactions, tumor microenvironment, cancer metabolism, drug resistance, and cell signaling using wide collection of tools, including 3D/organoid cell cultures, genetically-engineered and transplantation-based animal models, single-cell analysis, metabolomics, high-throughput microscopy, and other advanced technologies.
