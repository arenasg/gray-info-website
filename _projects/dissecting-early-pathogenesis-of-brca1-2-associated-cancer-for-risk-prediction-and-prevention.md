The overarching goal of this proposal is to gain better molecular knowledge of early lesions in order to improve prediction, early detection and cancer prevention for BRCA mutation carriers. While germline mutations in the DNA repair genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer dramatically elevated risk of cancers of the breast, ovary and pancreas, the precise pathogenesis of BRCA1/2-associated cancer remains to be elucidated. Dr. Leif Ellisen at MGH is carrying out systematic studies of early events that give rise to these cancers, in part through detailed molecular analysis of normal and pre-cancerous tissues from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Defining the altered signaling and early cooperating events in this context may reveal new markers of breast cancer predisposition and new targets for prevention. Dr. Ellisenâ€™s recently published single-cell genome analysis has revealed extensive chromosomal damage in BRCA1/2-mutant breast tissues that precedes any histological abnormalities, implying the existence of early cellular defects and associated vulnerabilities that could be exploited for cancer prevention.
