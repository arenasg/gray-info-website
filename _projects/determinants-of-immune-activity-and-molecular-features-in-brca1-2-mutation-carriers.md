This project aims at creating a biorepository that will allow a better understanding of the interplay between molecular features and immunogenicity in BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer, which represents critical information in the design of novel therapies. The BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are host to a suite of different mutations that are associated with varying levels of risk. Dr. Katherine Nathanson's group at the University of Pennsylvania has demonstrated the frequency of different BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, their distribution around the world, and risk of cancers associated with these mutations. Her team has also characterized tumors associated with BRCA1/2 germline mutations and demonstrated that a significant proportion do not have allele-specific loss of heterozygosity, associated with differential genetic/genomic characteristics and survival after treatment.
