The overall goal of this project is to better understand how microbes and the immune system interact and how this affects the development of BRCA breast cancers. Over half of breast cancer cases are unrelated to known risk factors, highlighting the importance of as yet undiscovered determinants of breast cancer risk. Dr. Charis Eng hypothesized that interactions between the breast microbiome and local immune responses to influence breast cancer pathogenesis. Engâ€™s group is comparing the microbiomes of healthy and diseased breast tissue to identify microbial profiles associated with the disease and reveal how different interactions between the immune system and the breast microbiome relate to disease progression.
