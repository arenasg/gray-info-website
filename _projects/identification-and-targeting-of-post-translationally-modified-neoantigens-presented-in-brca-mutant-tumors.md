The goal of this proposal is to better understand the immune status of BRCA tumors in order to target them using a cancer vaccine (or other immunotherapy approaches). Patients who carry inherited mutations in the BRCA genes accumulate DNA damage in their cells as a result of the lack of normally functioning BRCA proteins. This DNA damage in turn leads to a cellular stress response that causes certain proteins in the cell to be altered compared to those in healthy cells. Recently, scientists discovered that BRCA cancer cells can expose fragments of these atypical proteins to T lymphocytes in the immune system, stimulating the T cells to fight the cancer. Dr. Lew Cantley at Harvard Medical School is identifying which protein fragments are frequently exposed on the surface of precancerous cells. This knowledge could drive development of a vaccine that will enhance immune attack of early-stage lesions and thereby delay or prevent cancers in people with inherited BRCA mutations.
