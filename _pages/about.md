# ABOUT

Men and women with mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene are at an increased risk of developing certain cancers, including breast, ovarian, pancreatic, or prostate. The Gray Foundation aims to transform the prevention, early detection, and treatment of BRCA1/2 mutation-associated cancers by facilitating active collaboration of innovative, multi-institutional research teams aligned with this goal. In addition, these teams are committed to making the resulting data broadly and usefully available to the scientific community via this atlas.

The Gray Pre-Cancer Atlas project is using a range of newly developed single cell and spatial profiling technologies, in addition to more traditional genomic and cell biology approaches, to study human tumors. Spatial profiling methods such as highly multiplexed tissue imaging, spatial transcriptomics, and spatial proteomics make it possible to identify the positions, activities, and interactions of different cell types within the 3D tumor microenvironment. They promise to provide significant new insights into cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis drug resistance. Together, we expect that these data – in combination with carefully curated information on patients - will transform how BRCA1/2 mutation-associated cancers are prevented, detected, and managed.  

The Gray Foundation Atlas represents a consolidated resource for accessing Gray Foundation research on BRCA1/2 diseases. The Atlas was launched in the Fall of 2023 and is expected to grow over the next few years – please check back for updates.
