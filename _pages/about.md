# ABOUT

The Gray Foundation seeks to transform treatment and prevention for BRCA1/2 mutation-associated cancers through innovative research and new profiling methods. Emerging spatial profiling technologies, including highly multiplexed tissue imaging and spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, make it possible to identify the positions, activities, and interactions of different cell types within the 3D tumor microenvironment. Such data provide significant new insight into disease progression, metastasis, and drug resistance and promise to transform traditional histopathological diagnosis of disease. The greatest barrier to wider and more effective use of highly multiplexed tissue images is the incomplete level of software development for analyzing and sharing such data. The Gray Foundation Data Portal supports the Gray Foundationâ€™s research into early detection, prevention and treatment of BRCA1/2-associated cancers by providing a platform for investigators to collect, analyze, and share spatial profiling data and integrate them with other data modalities.
