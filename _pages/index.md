# ADVANCING CANCER RESEARCH

The Gray Foundation is transforming how we identify and study the earliest stages of cancer to enable treatment before the cancer spreads. The Atlas focuses on breast and ovarian cancers and the impact on these diseases of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, which substantially increases the hereditary risk of cancer and also impacts treatment options for spontaneous cancers.
